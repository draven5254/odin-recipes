          <li>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="method-title">Put pasta water on to boil:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2
              quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while
              for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your
              pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the
              water is heating.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3 class="method-title">Brown the ground beef:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high
              heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on
              all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain
              off all but a tablespoon of fat.
            </p>

              Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:
            </h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo
              we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions). Cook for 4 to 5
              minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers
              softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
              Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce
              the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.

          <li>
            <h3 class="method-title">Make the sauce:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot.
              Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the
              pot. Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting
              the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic
              salt, to taste. Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in
              sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to
              taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how
              acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.) Add salt to taste,
              and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.
              Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a
              low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the
              bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom
              and scorches. Remove from heat.

          <li>
            <h3 class="method-title">Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be
              boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente,
              per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)
              Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains
              at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent
              noodles from sticking. When ready, drain in a colander and rinse
              with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be
              sticking together. Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed
              baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet,
              turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the
              olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.

            <h3 class="method-title">Assemble the lasagna:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and
              spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of
              lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, the edges may
              overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of
              the remaining sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle a layer of a third
              of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of
              the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple of
              inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the
              top of the ricotta cheese. Apply the second layer of noodles and
              top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining
              mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the
              remaining Parmesan. Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread
              the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle
              with the remaining mozzarella cheese.

            <h3 class="method-title">Bake:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, (tented slightly so it
              doesn't touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes.
              Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top
              or edges.

          <li>
            <h3 class="method-title">Cool and serve:</h3>
            <p class="method-details">
              Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 before serving.
              Leftovers will keep for about 5 days. You can reheat it in a
              conventional oven or microwave. Leave the aluminum tent on for
              storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)
